                                    despite her father's wishes. It also serves as Moana's "I want"

                                    legend, but later turns out to be a diversion allowing him to

                                    Moana kicks off the song as a distraction to buy Maui time to 
                                    reclaim his fish hook, but Tamatoa eventually discovers this, 
                                    setting off a battle between the two titans. During the climax of

                                    As witnessed by Moana, the demigod hones his strength by slicing

                                    what her heart is saying. While seeing her wayfinding ancestors in
